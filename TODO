Driver:
 * Persistent network interface naming
 * Use unix sockets to communicate with frontends
 * (?) Add docs
 * (?) Add a target to build hald-addon and write hal rules
Frontends:
 1. Dump current link status (perfect for use with conky)
 2. Get geographical information from GPS if available and write it to
   the log along with connection status/parameters
 3. (?) Notify the user on state change via GUI
 4. (?) or write a network manager plugin
