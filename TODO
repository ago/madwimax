Driver:
 * Adopt autotools
 * Add man page and docs
 * Change link status of the TAP interface when connected to/disconnected
   from the WiMax network
 * Write udev rules for the driver startup/pseudo-DVD blacklisting
 * Write to syslog
 * Use dbus(?) to communicate with frontends
 * (?) Add a target to build hald-addon and write hal rules
Frontends:
 1. Dump current link status (perfect for use with conky)
 2. Get geographical information from GPS if available and write it to
   the log along with connection status/parameters
 3. (?) Notify the user on state change via GUI
 4. (?) or write a network manager plugin
