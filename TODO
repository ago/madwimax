Driver:
 * Adopt autotools
 * Add man page and docs
 * Run user-provided scripts when the interface is brought up and down
   (for dhcp at least)

Frontends:
 1. Dump current link status (perfect for use with conky)
 2. Get geographical information from GPS if available and write it to
   the log along with connection status/parameters
 3. (?) Notify the user on state change via GUI
 4. (?) or write a network manager plugin
