Version 0.1.1
  - Added support for SWC-E100.
  - Added support for Mezon (www.mezon.lt) version of SWC-U200. You
    have to select the SSID from the command line at the moment, but
    this will be handled somewhat better in the future.
  - Updated udev rules to start madwimax by default when device is
    plugged.
  - Added madwimax manual page.
  - Change the default installation path of madwimax config files from
    $prefix/etc to $prefix/etc/madwimax.
  - Added several new options.
  - Lots of bugs fixed.
  - Cleaned up some pieces of code.

Version 0.1.0
  - Added a table of supported devices (fixes inability to connect to
    the devices with BL22 firmware out of the box).
  - Also device mathcing can now be controlled by the command-line options
    (namely --device and --exact-device). See the help.
  - Added an option to detach pseudo-DVD kernel driver by the driver
    itself (so it works without udev/sysfs).
  - Now autotools are used for build system.
  - The driver can run user-supplied scripts on network connect/disconnect.
  - TAP interface mtu is set to 1386 at startup.
  - Can now log to the specified file/syslog (when daemonized).
  - Allocated network interface is called wimaxN instead of tapN.
  - Various fixes and enhancements.

Version 0.0.2
  - Fixed reconnection issue. The driver was not able to repair a failed
    connection at all.
  - Fixed some rare startup problems. The driver now flushes the garbage
    from the previous session.
  - Added command-line options parsing.
  - Added support for diode control.
  - Added an option to daemonize the driver.
  - The driver now brings the TAP interface up when the device connects
    to the network and down when the connection is lost.
  - The driver immediately exits when it founds device unplugged so now
    it can be safely started by udev when device is plugged.
  - Various minor fixes.
  - Cleaned up code.

Version 0.0.1
  - Initial networking support.
